# Sort Visualizer

### Introduction
This GitHub project is a C++ sort visualization program that makes use of the SFML library.
Users can evaluate and visualize various sorting algorithms.
The application offers an interactive way to select, visualize algorithm and generate data.

### Technologies used:

The Sort Visualizer application is built using the following technologies and tools:
- C++ programming language for the application logic
- SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library) for graphics and user interface
  
### Features
1. **Data displayer:** Data displayed on screen as a graph and automatically adjusted.
2. **Data generation:** Data set can be easily generated and mixed.
3. **Algorithms variety:** Eight different sorting algorithms: Bubble, Selection, Insertion, Merge, Quick, Heap, Radix, std::sort.
4. **Visualizer:** The application visualizes the sorting process step by step, allowing to see how each algorithm sort the data.

### Installation:
1. [ ] Clone this project from GitHub
2. [ ] Visit the official [SFML](www.sfml-dev.org) website to obtain version 2.6.0 or higher.
3. [ ] In your preferred C++ IDE or code editor, open the project folder.
4. [ ] Add SFML to your project.
5. [ ] Build and compile the source code.
6. [ ] Run project.

### Usage
- Click on **[algorithm name]** to select one of eight algorithms.
- Click on **'Sort'** button to start the visualization.
- Click on **'Generate'** to create new data set.
